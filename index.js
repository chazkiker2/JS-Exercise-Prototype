  ? In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:

  1. In the global scope, the value of "this" refers to the base object â€”â€” either window or console, depending 
  on whether the developer is working in the browser environment or node environment. (window for browser, console for node)
  
  2. Implicit binding makes up for 80% of "this" keyword use cases. Whenever a function is invoked by way of the dot 
  operator, "this" keyword refers to the object prededing the dot. <object>.<method_name> â€”â€” the object is "this" and 
  the specified method is called by "this" object. 
  
  3. When the "new" keyword is utilized to invoke a constructor function, "this" refers to the new instance of the 
  freshly constructed  object. This probably makes up another 17% of the "this" keyword use cases. 

  4. Explicit binding of the "this" keyword is by far the most niche and confusing use case of said keyword. JS allows 
  developers to call call(), apply(), or bind() to explicitly and definitively bind a certain object ("this") to the keyword 
  in the context of a given function. The system will know that any time that function is called, it's referring to the "this" 
  that was explicitly bound in a previous statement.
